            <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4 text-foreground">Purpose</h2>

            <p>
              We are committed to protecting and maintaining the privacy of your personal information. Information collected is handled in accordance with Australian privacy laws and regulations, in particular, the Privacy Act, and is retained in accordance with legislated retention requirements.
            </p>

            <p>
              By providing personal information to us, you consent to our collection, use, storage, disclosure and management of your personal information in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) ("Privacy Act") and this Policy.

            <p>

In this Policy, "personal information" has the meaning given to it in the Privacy Act and includes any information or opinion, whether true or not, about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable.
            </p>

            <p>We may collect the following types of personal information:</p>

Sensitive information is subject to a higher level of privacy protection than Personal Information.
